In her book <a href=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/540664/because-internet-by-gretchen-mcculloch/ target=_blank>Because Internet</a>, linguist Gretchen McCulloch explains that <q>...while <strong>lol</strong> started out indicating laughter, it quickly became aspirational, a way of showing your appreciation of a joke or defusing a slightly awkward situation even if you didnâ€™t technically laugh at it.</q> When a term that literally means <strong>laughing out loud</strong> isnâ€™t necessarily used for laughter anymore, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of a personâ€™s intentions."},{"type":"text","value":"But the nuances of digital laughter run even deeper than just evolving meaning. Two other huge factors of its intended effect are length (e.g., <strong>ha</strong> vs. <strong>hahaha</strong>), and capitalization. McCulloch conducted a survey in 2017, she found that <q>the youngest group [of survey participants] flat-out rejected the idea of capitalizing <strong>lol</strong> or using it to indicate real laughter, even when expanded to <strong>LOLOLOL</strong>, and instead preferred the meanings of amusement, irony, and even passive aggression.</q> So many variables at play! In this next chart you can go deeper to see not only the market share of each laugh, but the ratio of lower to uppercase usage."}]},"rank":{"instructions1":"Pick a laugh. Not familiar?
